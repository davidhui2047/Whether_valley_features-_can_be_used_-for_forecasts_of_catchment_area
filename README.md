# The different weekly earnings between black and not black people
<b>Aim:</b> <br> To ascertain whether valley features (width or length) can be used to get precise forecasts 
of catchment area.

<br><br>
<b>Background:</b> <br> There is a vast difference of characteristics between each valley. This project would like 
to investigate whether valley features (width or length) can be used to get precise 
forecasts of catchment area. This report primarily based on a fjords dataset, which 
contains the data (width or length) on fjords from the South Island of New Zealand and 
British Columbia Canada.

<br><br>
<b>Findings:</b> <br> 1. The best model for the fjords in British Columbia Canada is the investigate models that use a log-log transformation for the length. 
<br>2. The best model for the fjords in New Zealand is the investigate models that use a log-log transformation for the width
<br><br>
<b>Discussion:</b> <br> A outlier in the fjords dataset of New Zealand is removed as it’s a influential outlier, but a outlier in the fjords dataset of British Columbia is not removed as it’s not a influential outlier. Log-log transformation is used for both British Columbia and New Zealand. Missing data for New Zealand are not removed as removing the missing data will affect the accuracy of the result.
